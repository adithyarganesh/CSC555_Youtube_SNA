# CSC 555 - FINAL PROJECT

Team members: Adithya Raghu Ganesh (araghug), Meghana Ravindra Vasist (mravind)

The code is submitted as final_project.ipynb

Run the code on Google Colab from the first cell. Authorize the drive and paste the authencation code in the text box given once you run the second cell. This will mount the drive and gives access to the dataset.

The dataset is very large. Hence, it takes a while to run. There are few measures like omega, betweenness centrality and eigen centrality measures which take a long time to run, about 1.5 hours.

# Google Colab

Adding dataset shortcut to drive  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I7gQ4S7FVWc-TJ_IInoyWFh8o38ZzvVr?usp=sharing
Navigate to the above link and add the folder as a shortcut to drive so that the dataset can be accessed easily while running the code blocks

Please find in the repository a file named "Final_Project.ipynb". This was added from colab and can be accessed for viewing the python script.

# Note

requirements.txt has not been added to the document as all the required dependencies will be added when running the colab notebook itself.
